# The Catholic Place

Welcome to the Catholic Place, where you can study the Catholic Faith and create beautiful content similar to what you see here. 

The Catholic Place is both a repository of Catholic information *and* a place where you can create your own content.

Create your own bible study, take notes and share your knowledge with others. In cooperation with Kobble, Catholic Place makes it easier than ever to research, take notes, write articles and reference historical literature. Catholic Place will become your favorite place- where everything you are interested in is organized in one place... just the way you like it.
